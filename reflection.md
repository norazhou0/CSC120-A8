Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
I created a robot class with attributes including name, age, color, size, freehand, owner, battery, and heldItem. I also set the maximum and minimum sizes the robot can grow and shrink. The robot can grab an item using its free hand and drop it when asked. It can examine and use itmes, walk in a specified direction, and fly for a given number of rounds and minutes. For each action, the battery decreases accordingly, so there's a rest method to recharge it. Lastly, the robot does not support an undo function. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I added a toString method to print out the robot's status information.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Brainstorm what object to create and how to implement the contract. It might be overwheming to start from scratch at first, so start simple and gradually add layers to it, and you will enjoy the freedom.
